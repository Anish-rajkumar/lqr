# LQR_controller for an active suspension system of a quarter car model
#   The main objective of this project was to analyze and simulate the mathematical model of an active suspension system for a quarter car model which is implemented with a LQR (linear quadratic regulator) controller. The suspension system of an automobile is rated based on different characteristics like  passenger comfort and stability of the vehicle based on ride quality and also handling of the vehicle. There are different types of suspension system which are passive suspension system and active suspension system, in the passive suspension system it uses spring and damping coefficients which are fixed by the designer but the downside of this system is its compromise between the rating parameters of the suspension system. In this project LQR controller was adopted to active suspension system which was used to negate the compromise between the comfort and handling of the vehicle and the simulation and analysis of the active suspension system was done using MATLAB and SIMULINK by using different road profiles as the road disturbances.
